American democracy is built on a system of checks and balances, created by our founders and written into our constitution, to prevent exactly the thing that is happening today.

If you, too, recognize that our [courts have no power to enforce their rulings](https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2025/02/11/jd-vance-trump-executive-power-supreme-court-00203537), and congress will not act until their constituents [rise up and shut down the country](https://www.newyorker.com/podcast/the-new-yorker-radio-hour/the-aclu-vs-trump-20) in protest, then join us [every Friday in our Telegram channel](https://t.me/StrikeForDemocracy). Each Thursday evening we'll shut down the old poll, and Friday morning we'll start a new one, asking you to renew your commitment to shutting down the country as a means to restoring our democracy.
