American democracy is built on a system of checks and balances, created by our founders and written into our constitution, to prevent exactly the thing that is happening today.

The Guardian reports that some GOP members of Congress are afraid to oppose Trump [because of fear for their safety](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/27/republicans-trump-threats) and the safety of their family. So, what happens if the courts can't stop the Trump regime?

## Let's All Swallow the Red Pill Together

We've spoken to our fellow Americans at protests and in line at the grocery store, in the living rooms of friends and family, in online communities and in the offices of our co-workers; the conversations all have a common theme— many of us are just scared shitless and we don't know what to do or what's going to happen. Our proposal to you is this: let's embrace the possibility that we're living in a Sci-Fi dystopia, and band together to find a glimmer of hope and community.

> Give me liberty, or give me death.<br>
> — Patrick Henry

So, from this point forward, let's embrace the fiction[^3] that Trump is a ruthless dictator— one who will soon eliminate the independent press, prevent a truly free and fair election, and strip away our First Amendment rights to political speech such as this. That's the context for the quote above; that living in a free democracy— and supporting free democracies around the globe— holds more importance to us than anything else. This site is all about what we can do, and how we can stop this, should we wake up one day and find the sci-Fi dystopia is real.

[^3]: Well, we *hope* it's a fiction.

If you're still reading, even if you're thinking "wow, these people are NUTS!", then I invite you to join us here and on [Telegram](https://t.me/SfD_2025) every week, if only just to see what we're up to and to see the reactions to our updates.

We're in this together[^4].
