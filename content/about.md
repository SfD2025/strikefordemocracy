The Strike for Democracy is the result of a middle aged man and his daughter deciding that the Trump regime needed to be stopped, and after watching videos and reading articles [like the one in The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jan/15/stand-up-and-be-counted-six-ways-to-protest-that-will-make-your-voice-heard), this was the best idea we had.

The choice of [Telegram](https://telegram.org/) was based on a few factors.

First, Telegram is heavily used by the Ukrainian military, including [Volodymyr Zelenskyy himself](https://t.me/s/V_Zelenskiy_official) - and it was after the [shameful meeting at the White House](https://apnews.com/article/trump-zelenskyy-vance-transcript-oval-office-80685f5727628c64065da81525f8f0cf) that I decided that, for all intents and purposes, America had fallen to a dictator. This is also evidenced by the US voting with Russia, North Korea, and Belarus (all dictatorships) opposing a UN resolution condemning Putin's invasion and supporting Ukraine's territorial integrity.

Second were technical and practical considerations - Telegram is free and had the features we needed for a light-weight poll that would support millions of users.

Third, for darkly pragmatic—and, admittedly, slightly fearful—reasons, I chose Telegram because it is heavily used by far-right extremists—domestic terrorists whom I firmly oppose, but who have strongly supported the president and often been praised by him for their 'patriotism'. Thus, I consider it unlikely the platform would be readily or easily banned by the tech oligarchs, in the event our movement grows to the scale we hope for.
