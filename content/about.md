The Strike for Democracy is the result of a middle aged man and his daughter deciding that the Trump regime needed to be stopped. Informed by articles in [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jan/15/stand-up-and-be-counted-six-ways-to-protest-that-will-make-your-voice-heard) and [The New Yorker](https://www.newyorker.com/podcast/the-new-yorker-radio-hour/the-aclu-vs-trump-20), this was the best idea we had. We wanted a weekly check-in for readiness to strike— we wanted our fellow Americans to see, every week, that hundreds, thousands, eventually millions of their fellow Americans were ready to stand with them in solidarity. We wanted you all to know, every week, that **you're not alone.**

The choice of [Telegram](https://telegram.org/) was based on a few factors.

First, Telegram is heavily used by the Ukrainian military, including [Volodymyr Zelenskyy himself](https://t.me/s/V_Zelenskiy_official) - and it was after the [shameful meeting at the White House](https://apnews.com/article/trump-zelenskyy-vance-transcript-oval-office-80685f5727628c64065da81525f8f0cf) that I decided that, for all intents and purposes, America had fallen to a dictator. This is also evidenced by the US voting with Russia, North Korea, and Belarus (all dictatorships) opposing a [UN resolution](https://news.un.org/en/story/2025/02/1160456) condemning Putin's invasion and supporting Ukraine's territorial integrity.

Second were technical and practical considerations - Telegram is free and had the features we needed for a light-weight poll that would support millions of users.

Third, for darkly pragmatic—and, admittedly, slightly fearful—reasons, I chose Telegram because it is heavily used by far-right extremists—domestic terrorists whom I firmly oppose, but who have strongly supported the president and often been praised by him for their 'patriotism'. Thus, I consider it unlikely the platform would be readily or easily banned by the tech oligarchs, in the event our movement grows to the scale we hope for.
