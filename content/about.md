The Strike for Democracy is a rag-tag band of nerds and students that have all come to the same conclusion— when the time comes that the Trump regime needs to be stopped, **massive**, **peaceful** and **non-violent** protests and civil disobedience are the solution. Informed by articles in [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jan/15/stand-up-and-be-counted-six-ways-to-protest-that-will-make-your-voice-heard) and [The New Yorker](https://www.newyorker.com/podcast/the-new-yorker-radio-hour/the-aclu-vs-trump-20), we felt this was our best shot. We wanted a weekly check-in for readiness to strike— we wanted our fellow Americans to see, every week, that hundreds, thousands, eventually millions of their fellow Americans were ready to stand with them in solidarity. We wanted you all to know, every week, that **you're not alone.**

## Telegram

The choice of [Telegram](https://telegram.org/) was based on a few factors.

First, Telegram is heavily used by the Ukrainian military, including [Volodymyr Zelenskyy himself](https://t.me/s/V_Zelenskiy_official) - and it was after the [shameful meeting at the White House](https://apnews.com/article/trump-zelenskyy-vance-transcript-oval-office-80685f5727628c64065da81525f8f0cf) that I decided that, for all intents and purposes, America had fallen to a dictator. This is also evidenced by the US voting with Russia, North Korea, and Belarus (all dictatorships) opposing a [UN resolution](https://news.un.org/en/story/2025/02/1160456) condemning Putin's invasion and supporting Ukraine's territorial integrity.

Second were technical and practical considerations - Telegram is free and had the features we needed for a light-weight poll that would support millions of users.

Third, for darkly pragmatic—and, admittedly, slightly fearful—reasons, I chose Telegram because it is heavily used by far-right extremists—domestic terrorists whom I firmly oppose, but who have strongly supported the president and often been praised by him for their 'patriotism'. Thus, I consider it unlikely the platform would be readily or easily banned by the tech oligarchs, in the event our movement grows to the scale we hope for.

Finally, Telegram made it possible to easily distribute polling and strike duties across the team, to ensure as best we can that the movement survives the loss of any members.

## The Team

Our movement has been heavily influenced by the [Otpor](https://www.nonviolent-conflict.org/otpor-struggle-democracy-serbia-1998-2000/) movement that overthrew Slobodan Milosevic in Serbia. Thus, from the outset, we strove to build a team of not only Americans, but also Friends of Democracy Watchdogs from around the world who would always have access to independent media in foreign democracies. That way, if the American members go dark for any reason, a Friend of Democracy will have the ability to pull the trigger for the strike.

Coordinating via Telegram, the team meets regularly to plan actions and update our public channel and messaging.
