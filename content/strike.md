title: The Strike
toc: false

Our ideal target would be 14 million "Yes" votes in [our weekly poll](https://t.me/StrikeForDemocracy), though perhaps as few as 12 million depending on the state of things. Once a given poll reaches 12-14 million "yes" votes, we'll steel our resolve and announce the strike date in the channel - potentially within the week if global events warrant.

## It will be hard - but not as hard as COVID

Each of us will need to prepare for the strike in our own way— stocking up on canned goods, renewing hobbies we started during COVID. Hopefully you will have already joined up with local protest groups, and will at least have the benefit of community with your fellow Americans as some of you take to the streets with your signs and banners.

I expect a rough few weeks— truthfully, though, I'm not sure it can be much worse than things are right now, or will be when fourteen million of us have decided we've had enough.

## Our Demands

You can find them in [the channel](ps://t.me/StrikeForDemocracy), but our demands are simple:
* Impeach and remove Donald Trump and JD Vance for aligning with foreign dictators
* Dissolve DOGE, remove Elon, restore civil services
* Renew alliances with Europe and Ukraine

## Ending the Strike
