title: The Strike
toc: false
type: docs

Our ideal target would be 14 million "Yes" votes in [our weekly poll](https://t.me/SfD_2025), though perhaps as few as 12 million depending on quickly things go south. Once a given poll reaches 12-14 million "yes" votes, we'll steel our resolve and announce the strike date in the channel— potentially within the week if global events warrant.

As you read this, remember— by the time the strike is triggered, it will be clear that our worst fears have been realized, and that the only solution is for all of us to rise up - **peacefully** - and refuse to go along with the loss of American Democracy. Once the strike starts, unless you're involved in life-saving care, you should stay home from work and let your employer know that we have come to the point of shutting down the country to save our democracy. I may lose my job, and you may lose yours— but by the time we get to that point, our jobs won't matter much in the grand scheme of things.

## It will be hard - but not as hard as COVID

Each of us will need to prepare for the strike in our own way— stocking up on canned goods, renewing hobbies we started during COVID. Hopefully you will have already joined up with local protest groups, and will at least have the benefit of community with your fellow Americans as some of you take to the streets with your signs and banners.

I expect a rough few weeks— truthfully, though, I'm not sure it can be much worse than things are right now, or will be when fourteen million of us have decided we've had enough.

## Our Demands

You can find them in [the channel](ps://t.me/SfD_2025), but our demands are simple:
* Impeach and remove Donald Trump and JD Vance for aligning with foreign dictators
* Dissolve DOGE, remove Elon, restore civil services
* Renew alliances with Europe and Ukraine

## Ending the Strike

Once the congress responds and acts to restore democracy, meeting at least the first two of our demands (the third will take more time), the SfD25 team will start meeting regularly to decide, as a group, when it's safe to re-start the country and re-start our lives.
