We updated our website domains, and added [sfd25.org](https://sfd25.org) for it's brevity. Both [strikefordemocracy.org](https://strikefordemocracy.org) and [sfd25.org](https://sfd25.org) will bring you here.

We also updated our Telegram channel with a shorter URL for the same reason - the new channel is [SfD25](https://t.me/SfD_2025). Since we updated the channel, we went ahead and posted this week's poll today, a day early.

## Strike for Democracy has chosen a Symbol

We chose the yellow lightning strike in large part for it's simplicity - we hope you'll adorn your shirts and jackets with this symbol to let others know they are not alone, a crucial part of our mission.
